# MY PORTFOLIO

## Purpose
This is a collection of the projects I've worked on so far as a full stack web developer. Using HTML, CSS, I built the following portfolio from scratch, incorporating flex boxes, media queries, and pseudo-classes.

The Run Buddy website on my page is probably the best representation of my skillset as it was an ongoing project for several weeks. The Horiseon site was a refactoring project provided to me to enhance the structure and alleviate excess syntax.

The Screenpunk, Jacob and Rhys vs. Evil, and Robot Gladiators are works in progress.
